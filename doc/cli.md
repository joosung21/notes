# Command Line Interface Commands

## `ls` Command

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. It displays the names of files and subdirectories, along with optional details such as file permissions, sizes, and modification dates, depending on the flags used.

**Common Options:**
- `-l`: Lists files in a long format, including file permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
- `-a`: Shows all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`).

## `cat` Command

The `cat` command (short for "concatenate") is used to display the contents of one or more files. It can also be used to concatenate multiple files into a single output and create new files from the command line.

**Common Options:**
- `-n`: Number the lines in the output.
- `> newfile.txt`: Creates a new file or overwrites an existing file with the output.
